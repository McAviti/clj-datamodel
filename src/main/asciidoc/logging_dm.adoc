== Central Logging Datamodel

=== Partitioning of the log record space

Each record has its own id value, making it unique in all of the data stores.

For managing the stores (especially the online research store for [A]), though, it is necessary to organize the records in
a number of dimensions. This separation then supports in the determination of

- Access rights/permissions
- Retention times
- Backup strategy

With that, the integrated applications can gain a lot of control and flexibility for *their* data.

The dimensions that are suggested is a combination, fitting to the actual need, of those fields:

- tenant (in case of a real multi-tenant system with separated accounts)
- environment (if environments are not separated pyhsically or logically on the server side)
- solution, this determines the organizational owner of the log records within a tenant
- recordType, to distinguish between different needs of building blocks and types of logging and journal data.

=== Fields

Mandatory fields are printed [teal]*bold*.

.NDM fields
[options="header", cols="1,2,15,30"]
|===

|Type
|Field Name
|Short Description
|Long Description

|String |id |Technical id for the log record
|This can be set by the client (if trusted to care for uniqueness) or be omitted and set by the client. The server
allow the id to be reused (=update) for semantics like records of timespans (like, e.g., sessions).
Proposed algorithm is UUID.

4+|*Header Fields, meta data of each record*

|String |[teal]*recordType* |Type of the record.
|This is an unbounded enumeration, it's free to select from the solution; anyway, it is recommended to use a known value
(see subpage) to make recognition of the semantics of the record easier. Record types can be shared between solutions,
e.g. session, activity and techInfo are record types that are used by applications.
The record type is used for partitioning the CLJ data stores for the permission system, as well as a key in defining
retention periods and archiving strategy.

|String |recordSubType |Additional field to identify the event
|Can be used as a type of the source log record. For example is use as when the recordType is 'serverLog', the
recordSubType could be "tomcat" oder "weblogic".

|String | [teal]*tenant*	|Institute number
|If needed, for organizations serving multiple iurisdictional tenant, this is the tenant code.

|String | [teal]*environment* | Environment identifier
|If needed, when the development, test, staging, production etc. environments are not separted by dedicated data
store instances but merged in one, this identifier determines from which environment a log record originates.

|DateTime-WithFractionSeconds	|recordTimestamp	|When the log record has been created
|If the client does not provide this, or the given value cannot be parsed on server side, the processing engine will
create a timestamp as next best guess.

|String	|logLevel	|Level of importance, as provided by many low-level logging systems
|This field is optional, it is also not normalized, meaning that whatever the client solution provides here will be
taken as-is. A lot of logging libraries have their own mind on this topic.

4+|*User Info, information about the person or technical systems connected to the log record*

|String	|user	|Unique user id in its userType domain
|This identifies the user or system uniquely within the domain given in "userType". This value gets more gain in the
context of current data protection laws.

|String	|userType	|Domain this user account belongs to
|Needed if different user domains should be distinguished -- like internet users (customers) and intranet users
(employees). Or when user domains ob subsidiaries are not clearly separated by the user ids.

4+|*Source Info, which component wrote this log record*

|String	|solutionCode	|Unique identifier of solution	|Identifies the Solution as unit in the IT landscape.

|String	|solutionFunctionCode	|Id of functional building block|If needed, more fine-grained organizational partitioning.

|String	|sourceApplication	|Building block |More technical/architectural paritioning key.

|String	|sourceHostname	|System name of the server initiating the logging call
|e.g. DNS of physical or virtual system

|String	|sourceIp	|Client IP, originator of the log|The value might differ in regard of the nature of the originator
(e.g. a browser-based application, or a batch)

|String	|userAgent	|Software that initiated the call
|This field is used when the software and its version of the user/client is relevant. e.g. In web front-ends
this identifies the Browser that has been used. The writing solution can give any information if it thinks that
information about its caller makes a difference.

|String	|agentVersion	|TODO|

|String	|serverInstanceName	|Identifies the server instance|e.g. the docker pod

4+|*Initiating solution*

|String	|clientId	|Code from initiating system	|Inititiating systems are mostly user front-ends or batch
processes.

4+|*Harvesting Info, where was the log record first persistet, might be different from the source solution*

|String |sourceType |Syntax of the incoming data
|Syntax of the incoming data (into the messaging building lbock). 'generic' means using the NDM in JSON, this is the
default value. If the syntax is not 'generic' the central logging service might be able to to a proper transformation.

|String	|loggingHostname	|Server Host Name	|like sourceHostname

|String	|loggingHostIp	|Server IP address
|The system that provided the logging information, e.g. Apache host for access logs, or any other harvisting service
running logstash, fume, rsyslog or a similar tool.

|String	|logFile	|file name and path from which the log record has been harvested, if applicable
|If logrecords are not sent directly to the messaging building block, but harvested from a logfile
(by Logstash or a similar software) here this filename and path of the appropriate format (Windows, Unix,
Mainframe, â€¦) can be sent if needed.

4+|*Context*

|String	|parentId	|Hierarchical predecessor of this log record.
|Could be of a functional or sequential order	Here a key of a hierarchical higher-level record can be set.
So a tree-like structure of log records can be created.

|String	|contextId1	|Mapping context id field 1
|In the evJournal context this is the sessionId.

|String	|contextId2	|Mapping context id field 2
|In the evJournal context this is the activityId (Use Case ID).

|String	|contextId3	|Mapping context id field 3
|In the evJournal context this is the techInfoId.

|String	|contextId4	|Mapping context id field 4|

|DateTime-WithFractionSeconds	|startDate	|Start date of the record
|For journalling records that have a time span, this field of the event signals the begin timestamp.

|DateTime-WithFractionSeconds	|endDate	|End date of the session
|For journalling records that have a time span, this field of the event signals the end timestamp.

|String	|correlationId	|Correlation ID for a synchronous or quasi-synchronous call
|Unique Id that is created as early as possible (ideally by the initiator) and then guided through the whole call
hierarchy to create traces of calls.

4+|*Unstructured and semistructured data*

|String	|message	|Log Message
|All the information that is not part of other fields

|String	|additionalInfo	|semi-structured data |Business or other data.
Technically this is a text field. It is recommended, though, to use JSON syntax, because the front-end can interpret
it and display a tree structure. Special Case of additionalInfo: External Links. This can be rendered in the UI as
Link with following Syntax: additionalInfo.extlink.ref : The URI for the external Link;
additionalInfo.extlink.name : The DisplayName for the Link.

4+|*Result section*

|String	|resultCode	|Code if the record represents a task of any kind|HTTP record code, Exception, Error

|String	|errorMessage	|Error Message|Any standardized code or message the sending solutions wants to log.

|Boolean	|businessError	|Business Error
|Sometimes business errors are stored as normal messages. It is up to the application to decide which message is a
business error or a message. This value should be true for business errors

|Status |normalizedStatus |Status field red/yellow/green
|This field is for the user, giving a hint about whether this log record represents ok status, a warning or an error.
enum Status { red yellow green }

4+|*Technical information*

|String	|thread	|Name of the server thread|

|String	|logger	|Software origin |Name of the class and method(optional) which logs this message

|Long	|durationMs	|Duration of a call in milliseconds|

|String	|logProcessingError	|StackTrace of the log processing error.	|This is not provided by the client solution but used if anything goes wrong in CLJ log record processing.
